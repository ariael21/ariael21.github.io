Obviously, we still had to rush as we nearly missed this ferry too. we still made it though #hatersgonnahate\nWhile the ferry was arriving in Ischia (the main city on Ischia the Island), the speakers announced that the next stop was going to be Forio, a town on the other side of the island, where we planned on going to anyways. – we decided to stay on the boat with our partly valid ferry ticket. Nobody cared tbh\nThe harbour in Forio was located right next to the old town, which allowed us to take a quick walk through the city center. We mainly were focused on food + shopping. Also, we tried to avoid the midday sun by entering a cafe. (We ended up having Pizza though). Within the town, we found a local market where Thilo bought some new slippers while Samira admired the fish market. #vegan\nAs mentioned before, we ended up eating pizza again; this was by far the best pizza that we had until now! Full Tummy - Beach time bitches!! We found a nice shae-D place under a palm tree, squished together hiding from the sun. We brought our books as well as our diving glasses, so we always had something to do. Samira put some sunscreen on so that she could lay in the sand to get a nice skin peeling :p After several baths we played some Jassen, at which obviously Samira and Thilo won.\nIn the evening we caught the bus heading to Ischia city from where the ferry was going to depart. Samira and Yael failed their mission “buy bus ticket” (thanks for trying thoughhh At the port of Ischia, we got some more snacks + beers which we destroyed on deck. We were amongst the last passengers to enter the ship, which means that there were only some shitty seats left on the boat. We made ourselves comfortable on the floor at the back of the upper deck, which soon turned out to be the best place to be on the boat. From here, we had a veryyy nice view towards the island, being enlightened by the bloody red sun that was about to vanish behind the horizon! Everybody was jealous ;/\nBack in town, we obviously were in for some more “nourriture”, so we went to visit the vegan restaurant from the day before again! This time, Samira and Thilo ordered the plate that was initally recommended to us by the waiter (and not just the soup like the day before). The soup was lit though, you can ask Samira’s bowel movements which where rejuveniled by this delicacy.\nWe ended up drinking (some) good wine again. Our beloved waiter recommended us a bar close to their own restaurant; he told us to order a drink called “Taylors Ebony” or whatever. The bar guy eventually found out wtf we were talking about, so we ended up ordering the priciest, most alcoholic drink from the whole bar. (Timo and Thilo found that the liquids smelled like pure Jägermeister). We played some more Jassen, watched a gay couple kiss intensely \u0026 found approximately 20 other LGBTQs around our bar (we never felt this queer before.)\nObviously we went to bed quite late AGAIN, which will probably be the fate for all the upcoming nights too. we will keep you updated bitchezzz :*\nImages of the day ",

<p>After (again) going to bed way too late the evening before, we chose to let the ferry go that we planned on catching at 08.40 and to take the next one which departed shortly before 11am.

<p>While the ferry was arriving in Ischia (the main city on  Ischia the Island), the speakers announced that the next stop was going to be Forio, a town on the other side of the island, where we planned on going to anyways. &ndash;&gt; we decided to stay on the boat with our partly valid ferry ticket.
