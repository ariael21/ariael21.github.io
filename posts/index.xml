      <description>Ischia After (again) going to bed way too late the evening before, we chose to let the ferry go that we planned on catching at 08.40 and to take the next one which departed shortly before 11am. Obviously, we still had to rush as we nearly missed this ferry too. we still made it though #hatersgonnahate
While the ferry was arriving in Ischia (the main city on Ischia the Island), the speakers announced that the next stop was going to be Forio, a town on the other side of the island, where we planned on going to anyways.</description>

      <description>Pompeii After arriving late at night the day before, we decided to sleep out in the morning as we all felt a lil ded inside. We ended up brunching at around 12.
Todays Program: Pompeii! After doing some research &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; found out that there&amp;rsquo;s a bus going to Pompeii starting from the harbour. On our way to the harbour, we saw some relly nice vintage shops! We had to hurry to catch the buses though.</description>

      <description>Florence - Napoli Feeling fresh after a shitty sleeps at night, we headed to the train station to reach the next city on our list: Napoli. After some espresso shots we felt alive enough to start the next journey. In the train we did some actual productive work. :pog:
Samira - the next premium LinAlg TA - worked for about 2 minutes and continued to take a juicy nap. Get ready erstis.</description>

      <description>Cathedral After planning to get up early to go check out another camera store the day before, we decided to stay in bed for as long as possible in the morning. The cathedral was, as we thought, going to open at around 10am. We then thought it to be best to get to the church shortly before the opening to avoid the huge queues that we witnessed the day before. Turns out that there were already hundreds of people + the church opened at 10.</description>

      <description>Exploring Florence Early Morning; Surprisingly, the only person to experience some sort of hangover was Timo; the rest of us dealt quite well with the alcohol overload from the evening before. We then (obviously) brunched (cereals) and then headed for the city. We tried to get into the cathedral, however the queue was long enough to shoo us away. We then decided to check out the cathedral on the next day.</description>
