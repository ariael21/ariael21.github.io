We ended up brunching at around 12.\nTodays Program: Pompeii! After doing some research “we” found out that there’s a bus going to Pompeii starting from the harbour. On our way to the harbour, we saw some relly nice vintage shops! We had to hurry to catch the buses though. We had some difficulties with finding the right bus stop, there are several stops and the harbour is huge! Somehow, we found the right one and entered it one minute before departure lol.\nAfter the 40 minute bus ride we arrived at Pompeii. We went to the entry and bought the tickets. To get in for a cheaper price you have to be from the EU, so we decided to be from germany today. And poof, we got the tickets for 2€ each.\nWe all didn’t really know what to expect so we were quite amazed at how big the city actually is. We sort of expected it all to be a quite compact and small archeological site. We used GPSmyCity to get some nice information about the different findings.\nAfter 3 hours of walking, dehydrated af, we decided to leave the buried city. Right at the exit, 3/4 of us felt the urge to binge eat and thus ordered some nice sandwiches + tuna salad (#vegan) as a snack. We did need this break though! #rejuveniled\nShortly after we took the train back to Neapel. The train was really cracky, it’s one of those kinds where you immediately get several STDs just by looking at them. Anyways, back in the city we made the decision to book our next train reservations; then we searched for a nice place to eat. After a while we found a cute vegan restaurant, hidden in one of the many backyards in Neaples city. We bought a shit ton of food and wine. It was amazing. We went back to our AirBnB, drank some more Limoncello and played some JustDance.\nrestaurant recommendation: Acmicibio (or sumthng like that)\nImages of the day ",
