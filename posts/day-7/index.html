For breakfast we get served compact cracker-müesli with a few drops of milk (why do we always forget to go shopping though?!). Soon we realise that we still need to pack, clean and shower the hangover away, all within not even an hour before the train departs. With highspeed we try to finish our morning businesses before rushing into the nasty streets of Neapels again.\nWe decided to give the “most beautiful metro in the world” another shot and “jog” to the closest metro station. Here, Yael experiences her first mental breakdown for the day as the tickets are only available in some random crappy shops and not at the station itself. Also we kinda realised that we had no chance catching the train as the choochoo train was leaving in like 15 min whereas it would still take us over 20 minutes to even reach the train station. We decided to try catch the train anyways as the next available train was departing at 13.50 rather than 9.40 or sum like that.\nArriving at the Geraldini Metro station (Hauptbahnhof), we pushed our leg workouts to another dimension by climbing up way too many stairs coming from the depths of the dumbass metro. At the rails we got to see that our train in fact already has departed, which led to Samiras first mental and/or physical breakdown. (Personally i feel like it was due to the fact that half of her pullover emulgated with some sweat on her skin, yumyuuum)\nFirst things First we decided to let Samira rest and go reserve the next possible train going to Catania. (13:50). This obviously meant that we had several hours to pass before having to check in again. Out of this conflict two main forces arose, both having interests differing from the other; Team Thilo and Jail (lets call them TY) VS Hilde \u0026 Albert (Hildabert).\nTeam Hildabert decided to stick around the main station, drink coffee \u0026 shop a little (Hildabert Edit: We also spent over an hour trying to register for the shitty PADI-website #giveussomecredit). Team TY on the other hand chose to go on another adventure; explore the crack quarter of Neaples, capture street arts with their cameras and much more. We also happened to end up in the best thrift shop that we’ll ever set foot in, drank some overpriced espresso (2€ at the table after i paid 90 cents the day before with takeaway) and explored further parts of the city. We obviously ended up being short in time AGAIN like bitch tf… the worst metro in town ended up disappointing us AGAIN by announcing the main station through the speakers while we were in fact NOT at the train station yet. So we obviously failed to recognize this error (like many others though) and ended up running AGAIN as we already were short in time before this incident. Yael happened to carry all the tickets from the baggage store where we dropped our stuff so Team Hildebart had no choice but to wait for Team TY to arrive at the bagagge store (which btw are extremely overpriced AGAIN). While being in the midst of TYs yearly workout one of the bags containing some juicy tomato pesto decided to YEET itself on the floor and flood Yaels newly bought All Star shoes. ALSO while trying to safe her pesto shoes, yael accidentally flushes down her shoelaces and clogging the train toilet by doing so (Oh happy day)\nAnyways, this time we made it on the train, which is one of the first good news until then.\nDuring the train Ride, Thilo tried to do some further ultrasound lessons whereas Hildabert and Jail formed an alliance by starting their online PADI diving course. Yael was very ambitious and set the bar high by proclaiming that she was going to finish the whole thing withing 3 hours rather than the 5 - 10 hours recommended. (They all ended up spending around 15 hours each for the course LOL).\nIn Messina, our train Yeeted itself on the ferry which brought us + train to the island of Sicily. Timo missed the sunset by getting lost on the ferry :/\n(Timo Edit: I did see it but I was all alone ._. )\nWe arrived in Taormina around 10 pm from where it only took us 5 min to reach our juicy, so far best AirBnB. The newly allied groups tried to desperately complete their online diving course while Thilo scheduled his days that he was going to spend alone as he already completed the PADI courses. ",
