This time we got the full long sleeve equipment with hat and shoes to keep us warm long enough to complete another set of exercises in the water. Considering the current weather forecast, we were unsure if we could finish our course the next day and Alan told us to wait for his message in the morning. Equiped with a “blue sea diving tribe” t-shirt and the task to finally finish the e-learning we went straight back home to study… or at least that’s what should have done :) Being lazy as always however, we were much more interested in walking through Taormina and visiting its wonderful amphitheater ruins.\nHow to not do the divers theory exam After too much procrastination by looking at ancient ruins we procrastinated even more by cooking an amazing pasta with random ingredients. During dinner we got a drunk voice message from Thilo who apparently had met up with a couple of friends in Catania and he told us that he would not be able to come back to the Airbnb on the same day. As everyone except us could have foreseen, it got very late again until we did the last two chapters of the e-learning course. Suddenly, we realised that the final exam hadn’t unlocked yet. Alan then responded to our paniking question marks by telling us that we had to finish every single subchapter which we hadn’t because we did some parts together on one phone. After spending most of the following time waiting for the slow internet to load all pages to turn everything green the app was finally letting us do the exam. The clock was showing 00.43 for Yael and Timo and 01.06 for Samira when we eventually finished everything and could go to bed totally exhausted.\nSamira doing the theory exam at 1am:\n",
