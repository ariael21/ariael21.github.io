During the wait, Yael and Thilo roamed around the stores surrounding the cathedral (we drank some coffee) while Timo and Samira patiently waited for the queue to shorten. After a felt eternity, we finally could enter the building, which turned out to be sort of a flop as we excepted much more from the interior design. The painting decorating the dome is definitely the highlight of the whole experience, although it does not compensate the long wait that we all had to endure. We all would still do it again though as we would have regretted not entering the church, especially because our AirBnB was right around the corner of this famous spot.\nUs - walking around the city After the exciting church-trip we decided to go check out a “castle” that our drunks selves discovered the day before on map at a Pizzeria. This turned out to be some sort of military checkpoint or whatever. We took the tram back to the city cause we lazy.

It felt good though. We bought tickets for the Leonardo da Vinci Museum at 6 pm. The museum was quite underwhelming, it basically consisted of some remade models based on the sketches made by Queen Leonardo. Some of these models were very nice and innovative; we rediscovered the principle of the central mass, which can lead objects to “ascend” upwards on a slope (spooky) as well as some some mirrors and anatomy models. aperol and sunset on the Michelangelo Square As usual we decided to end the day with some Aperol-to-Go. We still had one open task to complete - the big Michelangelo Square, from where you can see the whole skyline of Florence. We were just in time for the sunset (+ sunset selfies). We stayed until the sun left the chatroom. Thicc beach bar Back in the city; We discovered a “beach-bar” next to the River. It seemed quite high fashioned, which didn’t stop us from entering. We got some fancy named cocktails and played cards - obviously Team Timo/Thilo won.
