We then found a cute place called “Pasta Place” where we, once again, ordered several plates of pasta. We also drank supergood beer (10/10), did some more jassen and used the seatless toilets in the restaurant.

Another local guy also observed her and commented: “THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE!!” in a thicc italian accent, which really made our day! (She didnt hear us fyi). We then headed to the oldtown where we strolled around the street until we reached the harbour of the city. From here you have a nice view on the whole city as well as Mount Cefalu, a very dominant, astonishing mountain shielding the cities back. We took several very nice pictures and enjoyed parts the sunset here before heading to the cathedral. The piazza del duomo was another highlight, the vibe pretty much summarised all of Italy’s good virtues which made us feel really comfortable.\nTo get back to the train station, we passed through a mountaineous path right below Mount Cefalu. From here we also got a pretty decent view above the city of Cefalu, from where we could enjoy the reddening sky.\nWe failed our mission to buy wine and thus headed to the train station with zero booze supplies. Back in Lascari we tried to reach a supermarket which happened to be closed. Buuuut right next to it there was a local Pizzeria / Bar, where we finally ended up eating Pizza AGAIN. We also drank some stuff ;* (note: comments about our alcohol consume are forbidden in this blog, read more in our AGB)\nTo get home to our “Villa”, we recruited the Bar Girl to call us a Taxi. Eventually we could hop into the Pizza Masters’ car for 10 Euros who brought us straight to our apartment! Spoiler; we met the Maestro again in Palermo the next day!
