After some espresso shots we felt alive enough to start the next journey. In the train we did some actual productive work. :pog:\nSamira - the next premium LinAlg TA - worked for about 2 minutes and then went to sleep. Get ready erstis. :D\nThilo - our supreme doctor gray - did some random x-ray lecture??\nTimo - the cutiepie - stuffed some italian words into his brain.\nYael - did some photo editing and shitty blogging,\nAfter 3 hours we arrived in Neapel.\nNeapel After 10 minutes in Neapel we already wanted to leave again. The city did not leave the best first impression. There is a lot of poverty and everything is extremely dirty. On our way to the air bnb we had to walk through shady neighbourhoods and it really was not the best sight/experience. We all felt really tense. However we were glad to find out that our rooms were in the center of the city. (so in a less shady part)\nAfter we settled in we got ready to go to Capri. We made our way down to the port while eating some 2 euro pizza.\nAlmost cooked alive from the sun we arrived at the port. Luckily we were there exactly 10 minutes before the next boat left.\nCapri We found a little shop near the port where we initially wanted to buy water. A guy came up to us and offered a boats tour around the island for 180€. We were unsure about the price, so we searched for more boat guys. Most of them offered us pretty shit deals so we went back to the first guy. Sadly we didn’t find him. However we found the most chill dude ever. Thilo pulled out his bargening skills and got us a pretty bomb deal: 3 hour private boat tour around the island with many stops and a (kinda illegal) swim in the blue grotto\nfuck yea, thanks thilo Our boat trip started and we started to drive around the island. We were all amazed at how beautiful the cliffs of the island were. The guide showed us some of the attraction and used his phone and google translate to explain them to us. He was pretty chill. 10/10 would book again.\nOn our first stop Yael lost her swimming gogglea but Thilo got them back. He can like dive 10 meters down in one breath?? Is he even human? Nobody knows.\nWe continued our trip drove throught that one really famous hole in the rock:\nWe went to the green grotto and the champain thingy. This time Yael and Samira both lost their goggles but we got them back again.\nOur last stop was the blue grotto. Most tourists go in with a small boat but it was already late and the boats were gone. So we just swam inside while trying not to get smashed into the walls by the waves. Inside the cave the water shines in a bright blue. There are two holes in the cave where the light can come in.\nAfter a while we went back out again. While trying to get out Yael kicked the wall and smashed her big toe a lil.\nBack on the boat we drove back to the main port. Looking like the crackheads that we are, we went to a little beach and ate our Vorspeise: Hard bread and hummus.\nAt like 8 we decided to walk up the fucking hill. It wasn’t hot anymore so the walking was quite alright. As we reached the center of Capri we searched for a restaurant. Everyone there looked very fancy.. and well, we didn’t.\nAfter a lil while we found a cute restaurant and ate there. We got some wine, got drunk and ran down the hill to catch the last ferry home.\nAt around 12 we arrived back at Neapel and went home. The city is totally different at night. The vibe is fantastic and it has some great bars. We were all very tired tho and so we just went home to get some rest.\nImages of the day ",

<p>Feeling fresh after a shitty nights sleeps we head to the train station to go to the next city on our list: Napoli.
After some espresso shots we felt alive enough to start the next journey. In the train we did some actual productive work. :pog:</p>
