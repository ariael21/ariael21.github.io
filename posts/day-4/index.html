In the train we did some actual productive work. :pog:\nSamira - the next premium LinAlg TA - worked for about 2 minutes and continued to take a juicy nap. Get ready erstis. :D\nThilo - our supreme doctor gray - did some random ultra sound E-Learning.\nTimo - the cutiepie - stuffed some italian words into his brain.\nYael - did some photo editing and shitty blogging,\nAfter 3 hours we arrived in Neapel.\nNeapel After arriving in Neapel, we tried to find the fastest route leading to our AirBnB close to the city center. We arrived in the city with high expectations created by the previous city Florence. However, after walking through Neaples for about 10 minutes, we felt the urge to leave the city as fast as possible again. We crossed some sort of shady neighborhood with neglected buildings, trashy street and lots of HoBoys. We didn’t really desire to see much more of the city, which was not that bad after all as we already planned on seeing other places close to Neaples like Capri, Ischia and Pompeii.\nAfter we settled at around 1pm we got ready to go to Capri. We made our way down to the port while eating some 2 euro Foccachia that we bought in Carrefour.\nAlmost cooked alive from the sun we arrived at the port of Neaples. Luckily we reached the gates exactly 10 minutes before the next ferry left for Capri. (Next ferry would have been at 4pm instead of 2pm)\nCapri Right after reaching Capri, Thilo proposed to go check out the local boat tours as he has already done such a tour in Capri the last time he has been here four years ago. A skipper approached us, offering a boat tour around the whole island for around 180€. We were unsure about the price, so we searched for more boat guys, trying to get a better deal. Most of them tried to scam us by charging much bigger sums, thus we tried to get back to the offer made by the first skipper. He was already gone, we saw him cleaning a boat in the port that we could not reach anymore. However ,we found the most chill dude ever working at the same stand. Thilo pulled out his bargening skills and got us a pretty bomb deal: 3 hour private boat tour around the island with many stops and a (kinda illegal) swim in the blue grotto\nfuck yea, thanks thilo Our boat trip started at around 1530 - we started to sail around the island. We were all amazed at how beautiful the cliffs of the island were. Our private guide showed us some of the attraction and used his phone and google translate to explain them to us. He was pretty chill. 10/10 would book again.\nOn our first swimming stop Yael lost her swimming goggles! She let them sink… but Thilo got them back. He can like dive 10 meters down in one breath?? Is he even human? Nobody knows.\nWe continued our trip by driving through that one famous hole in a rock;\nShortly after, We reached the green grotto and the champain thingy. This time Yael and Samira both lost their goggles but we got them back again due to Thilo’s freediving skills.\nOur last stop was the blue grotto. Most tourists go in with small boats, paying an extra 14£ each, but the blue grotto oficially closes at around 16:30. It was already at the time when we reached the grotto, so the tiny boats and most of the tourists were already gone. Our private skipper offered us to swim inside (illegaly), So we just swam inside while trying not to get smashed into the walls by the waves. The entrance of the cave consists of a rather small hole; The sea was a bit rough, which meant that we had to make sure that we didnt smash our skulls while entering. Inside the cave, light blue beams of light enlighten the water of the cave, creating a spooky, thrilling but yet beautiful atmosphere. We all sam across the cave, dived into its dephths and captured some of these moments with Yaels GoPro.\nWhile trying to exit the blue grotto, Yael kicked the wall and smashed her big toe a lil.\nBack on the boat we drove back to the main port. Looking like the crackheads that we are, we went to a little beach and ate our Vorspeise: Hard bread and hummus.\nAt like 8pm we decided to walk up the hill leading to Capri’s city center. The sun was not shining anymore, so the hike was quite alright. As we reached the center of Capri we searched for a restaurant. Everyone there looked very fancy while we all looked like a bunch of peasants.\nAfter a lil while we found ourselves in a fancy Villa/restaurant where we ordered pasta and Gnocchis (Yaels favorite meal for this trip). We ordered wine, got drunk and ran down the hill to catch the last ferry home.\nAt around 12 we arrived back at Neapel and went right to sleep. The city is totally different at night. The vibe is fantastic and it has some great bars. The city seems live from the younger generations; The streets are filled by young folks, making every weekday an “Ausgang”. We, on the other hand, were exhausted by the day; we just wanted to go home to sleep.\nImages of the day ",

<p>Feeling fresh after a shitty sleeps at night, we headed to the train station to reach the next city on our list: Napoli.
After some espresso shots we felt alive enough to start the next journey. In the train we did some actual productive work. :pog:</p>
