A rainy morning After we got up we immediately checked the phone for Alans message to find out if we could finish our diving course despite the weather conditions. When we saw that he hadn’t informed us yet we pictured the diving crew in our heads huddling together discussing if they could dare to make the dive. As it turned out they had already decided an hour ago to do it and the reason we didn’t get the Okay from Alan was that he had overslept, lol. We packed quickly and faced a difficult decision: should we wear shoes or flipflops? We made the wrong decision and our shoes and socks got completely soaked on our run to the train station through a dozen puddles caused by the sudden rain that was starting to pour like a bit*h the very moment we took a step out of the apartment. Our shoes never recovered from the stank they absorbed that morning. Will our feet ever smell normal again?? #staaank\nA rainy dive Ruining the Taxi’s nice seats with our wet asses we arrived at the diving center only a couple of minutes late and prepared for THREE (!) dives that day. On the boat to the diving site we had to hold on very tight not to get thrown off by the waves. Meanwhile, our Wetsuits got wetter and wetter by the increasing rain. Underwater we had to learn to navigate with a compass, swim without a mask and hover by inflating the suit with the mouth in turns. The others that were waiting had to fight the current, ending up needing to hold each other to stop bouncing all over the place. It was not easy but we were glad that we could train in such difficult conditions so we would know in the future what to do even without constant help from instructors. Props to Clement and Aga After a quick return to the “jungle base” we got on the boat again and drove to a bit more quiet diving site while the rain was filling up our boat. Here we practiced the emergency ascend and how to use a diving computer. Back on the boat after a while we realised Samira didn’t look too fresh anymore as her face had gone over to a greenish white color. Turns out she got seasick. Yael had to jump back into the water interrupting our instructor because she had to pee really really hard. In the mean time, Clement educated us about the extraordinary physical processes in our bodies leading to “having to pee while diving” #randomfacts.\nBecause we still couldn’t get enough we headed out again for our last “fun dive” to 18 meters depth with our instructors. It was quite fun but we were totally exhausted by the time we left the water. But we finally got our OPEN WATER CERTIFICATE!!! After we had said goodbye to everybody we went home tired and done af to freshen up and take a nap.\nThe rest of the day is covered in THILOS BLOG\n",
